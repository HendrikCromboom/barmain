# Introduction

 Demonstration of an OpenAI and AI Agent integration within MPC.
 Will run headless within what most likely will be a Django user interface.
 The entire project will set up something regarding a bartending, cocktail making app integrating AI. All wrapped withing detacheable Agents and components.
 I will probably use the new HTTP streaming communication method that is available in MPC as I have only been using IO and SSE before this.
 

 ## Resources

 - MPC Python SDK
 - Django SDK
 - PyCharm
 - Docker
 - PyTorch(If I find the time, if not the checkpoint will be arbitrary or a public LLM)

 ## Goal

 The goal is mostly to show of a manageable project that uses some software that I have been getting experience with in a personal project I am not yet willing to publish without a license.
 My proficiency with skills I want to mainly highlight are:
 - MCP(Not just a client, but the setup of an entire ecosystem)
 - Django(Since I have been focussing more on Python now then I ever have during my professional carreer)
 - Python(See above)
 - Reactive Architecture
 - Microservices

 ## Objects and Requests(Basic)

TBD
